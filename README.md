# SGX-Backed KGA with Gramine and SageMath
This repository contains the implementation of a Key Generation Authority (KGA) using SageMath library inside an Intel SGX enclave, built using the Gramine LibOS. 
The enclave securely handles key generation and distribution as part of a prototype Safety-Aware Drone Ecosystems (SADE) framework.
